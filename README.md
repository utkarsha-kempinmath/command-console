An interactive, terminal-inspired portfolio built to showcase projects, achievements, and technical capabilities through a structured command-deck interface.

> Interface Initialized. Commander: Utkarsha Kempinmath  
> Status: Operational


## 🌌 Overview

This portfolio is designed as a futuristic command interface rather than a traditional scroll-based website.

Instead of stacked sections, the experience is structured like a navigation system:

- Project Archive — Catalogued deployments & case studies  
- Mission Logs — Achievements, incubation programs & milestones  
- System Capabilities — Technical stack & proficiencies  
- Education Records — Academic background  
- Transmission — Contact gateway  

Each project opens in a dynamic side panel with visual captures, stack breakdown, and repository links.


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (TypeScript)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide Icons
- Modular Component Architecture

- Dynamic project rendering via structured data  
- Conditional GitHub & Live Demo links  
- Screenshot gallery per project
